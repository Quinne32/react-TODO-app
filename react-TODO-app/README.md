1. The state for the todos was stored in local storage so when we come back to the page at a later time all our data is still there
2. All the state in the application uses useReducer and Context to pass the state between components
3. Added the ability to delete existing todos
4. Added a form that lets you filter todos by their name and hide completed todos
5. Added the ability to edit existing todos
